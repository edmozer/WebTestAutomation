# I've compiled a set of web test automation scripts in this repository, designed using Java, Cucumber, Gherkin, and JUnit. To run these tests, ensure you have Java 11 SDK installed on your machine.

## The automation covers three distinct websites:

- https://seubarriga.wcaquino.me
- https://automation-sandbox-python-mpywqjbdza-uc.a.run.app
- https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login
  
Features tested include:

- Login
- Register
- Invoice
  
For detailed information on each feature, refer to the respective feature files, where comments provide insights into the elements being tested.
